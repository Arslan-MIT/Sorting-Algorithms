# Sorting Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Repository**! This repository contains implementations of five fundamental sorting algorithms. Each algorithm is explained in detail, including time complexity, space complexity, and use cases, to help you understand their strengths and weaknesses. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository serves as an excellent resource for mastering sorting algorithms.

## **Sorting Algorithms Included**

### 1. [Quick Sort](./quick-sort/README.md)
- **Description**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array and sorts each partition recursively.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best/Average Case**: `O(n log n)`
  - **Worst Case**: `O(n²)` (occurs when the pivot is the smallest or largest element repeatedly).
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **O(log n)** (due to recursion stack).
- **Best Use Cases**:
  - When average-case performance is more critical than the worst case.
  - For large datasets where memory efficiency is important.
- **Avoid When**:
  - Input is already sorted or nearly sorted (to prevent the worst-case scenario).

---

### 2. [Merge Sort](./merge-sort/README.md)
- **Description**: A stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **All Cases**: `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **O(n)** (due to temporary arrays during merging).
- **Best Use Cases**:
  - When stability is required (e.g., sorting linked lists or datasets with comparable elements).
  - When working with very large datasets.
- **Avoid When**:
  - Space is a constraint, as it requires additional memory.

---

### 3. [Bubble Sort](./bubble-sort/README.md)
- **Description**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: `O(n)` (if the array is already sorted).
  - **Worst/Average Case**: `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **O(1)** (in-place sorting).
- **Best Use Cases**:
  - For small datasets.
  - When simplicity and ease of understanding are the primary goals.
- **Avoid When**:
  - Working with large datasets due to poor performance.

---

### 4. [Selection Sort](./selection-sort/README.md)
- **Description**: An in-place comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it in the sorted portion.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **All Cases**: `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **O(1)** (in-place sorting).
- **Best Use Cases**:
  - When memory efficiency is crucial, and dataset size is small.
  - In embedded systems with limited memory.
- **Avoid When**:
  - Working with large datasets, as it's slower compared to other algorithms.

---

### 5. [Insertion Sort](./insertion-sort/README.md)
- **Description**: A comparison-based algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: `O(n)` (for nearly sorted arrays).
  - **Worst/Average Case**: `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **O(1)** (in-place sorting).
- **Best Use Cases**:
  - When the input size is small or nearly sorted.
  - In real-time systems where simplicity and stability are needed.
- **Avoid When**:
  - Sorting large or random datasets due to inefficiency.

## **Choosing the Best Sorting Algorithm**
| **Scenario**                                 | **Recommended Algorithm** |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Large datasets with average-case performance priority | Quick Sort               |
| Stable sorting with consistent performance   | Merge Sort               |
| Small or nearly sorted datasets              | Insertion Sort           |
| Memory-constrained environments              | Selection Sort           |
| Educational purposes or small datasets       | Bubble Sort              |
